# kanakami
An anime inspired, Japanese alphabet studying program using flash cards with optional shuffled and quiz modes.

I have not fully implemented the katakana or chart modes for the program.

If quiz mode is active then after a random number of flash cards studied a quiz of 5 kana will start.
